	<h2>Mica Team</h2>
	<p>Mica Team is the developer company of Girls Frontline and has only been officially around
	since 2013. As of now they have been recently expanding their company and have been taking on
	more projects surrounding the Girls Frontline IP with an official anime releasing in 2021,
	a remake of their first official game which will connect itself to the main storyline of 
	Girls Frontline, GFL's sequal, and two more spinoff games.</p>

	<h2>Origin</h2>
	<p>In 2008 Mica Team was originally formed as a "Doujin Circle" which is essentially a group of people
	who share a common interest, hobby, or job that like to work with each other similarly many fan groups
	dedicated to various media properties in the anime, video game, and manga sphere. Mica Team started off
	creating artbooks for the popular game series Touhou, the light novel and anime series Haruhi Suzumiya,
	and the popular anime K-ON along with what could possibly be the original concept of Girls Frontline the
	the "Guns&Girls" series books. Around 2009 Mica Team created their first "gaming" project known as the
	visual novel "Girl of the Bakehouse". For the next few years Mica Team would expand upon their original 
	visual novel by adapting it into their first offical game "Codename: Bakery Girl" a strategy game which
	they released in 2013.</p>

	<p>For the next two years Mica Team would end up restructuring themselves into an official company and begin 
	developement on Girls Frontline itself. In 2015 Mica Team announced their official company name of "Sunborn" 
	(although they still go by Mica Team as well) along with the announcement of Girls Frontline which would officially release in 2016. 
	The game was initially released in Korea, mainland China, and Taiwan using three respective servers for the different player bases. 
	It wasn't until 2018 where Mica Team would release Girls Frontline globally allowing English speaking countries to gain access to the game.
	The Japanese release would be delayed later that year due to legal troubles involving the ownership of the name "Girls Frontline".
	As a result the Japanese release was renamed to Dolls Frontline after the long legal battle over the rights to the name.</p>

	<h2>Yuzhong</h2>
	<p>Director and Creator of Girls Frontline along with being the official CEO and owner of the company, Yuzhong is the 
	man responsible behind the inception the of the game along with all the future plans, story, writing, and even some artwork 
	within the game. Despite being the company CEO Yuzhong is heavily involved with the development of games and is often
	working with his own employees to ensure his creative vision is fully realized. Yuzhong initially began as a passionate 
	doujinshi and indie game developer with the Bakery Girl series being his passionate project during the early stages of Mica Team.
	His passion for video games and story telling can be found throughout the development of Girls Frontline as Yuzhong continues
	to experiment with different gameplay styles and continually delivering on engaging stories and twists. This is most evident
	with the crossover events Girls Frontline has with other series. The different franchises that crossover with Girls Frontline 
	personally chosen by Yuzhong as he only collaborates with franchises that he really likes or feels that they fit themes of Girls Frontline.
	These series include the indie visual novel "VA11-HALLA" a cyberpunk setting that is extremely character focused and the manga/anime
	"Gunslinger Girls" which served as heavy inspiration for Girls Frontline. Unlike most company owners and CEO's Yuzhong really 
	understands his game's audience and greatly focuses on delivering a compelling experience to the dedicated fans who fell in 
	love with his creations.</p>

	“Hence, over the past two years, Yuzhong always felt that there was no need to force his games to become more mainstream or rope in the masses. 
	“Our target users are those who already like the genre of games that we make, so there is no reason to make everyone play our games. 
	On this basis, it is better to focus on managing our games, polishing them and improving on what we are good at, even expanding the gameplay when appropriate. 
	After all, the anime/manga culture is still a growing niche so the ceiling is quite noticeable. Big companies and publishers are focused more on chasing trends, 
	but trends come and go, just like their capital. However, we are willing to root ourselves in this genre and culture, and I think this is what differentiates 
	us from big companies.”

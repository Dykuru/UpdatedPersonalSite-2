	<h2>Summary</h2> 
	<p>Welcome Commanders to the world of Girls Frontline. Girls Frontline or GFL for short
	is a strategy mobile gacha game which can be found on various phone app stores. As a "gacha"
	game, Girls Frontline has an emphasis on collecting the various character that are named after
	many iconic firearms from the real world. Lauded for it's story the game is deceptive in it's 
	appearence as the seemingly cute anime artstyle masks a rather dark and complicated war story 
	that features large amounts of violence, geopolitics between nations, government espionage, 
	and horrors of war set in a near post-apocalyptic future. Girls Frontline is the second game
	developed by the Chinese based video game company MICA and the personal creation of it's head 
	developer and CEO Yuzhong. MICA has recently been aiming to expand GFL as a franchise with multiple new 
	upcoming games announced, a serialized manga, and official anime coming out sometime this year.</p>

	<h4>Setting and Story</h4>

	<p>The world of Girls Frontline takes place in an alternate Earth where an alien race crash
	landed centuries ago where they perished during their impact with the planet. After World War 2
	the Soviet Union uncovered the alien wreckages and salvaged their technology for themselves. This gave rise to 
	an age of great technological advancement and an arms race across the world over the developement of new weapons. 
	After a catastrophic event called the Beilan Island incident which resulted in Collapse Fluid a
	dangerously radioactive alien substance that was used in many advanced technologies to contaminate much
	of the planet leaving nearly half the world uninhabitable. This near apocalyptic event ignited 
	the Cold War into World War 3 resulting in many nations nearly being destroyed and an unprecedented
	loss of human life. In a post World War 3 world the nations now rely on DOLLs, advanced androids
	created during the end of World War 3 as a force multiplyer to replace the rapidly draining army
	reserves of various nations. Now these DOLLs are found in not only military but also civilian services
	to compensate for the lack of manpower in the remaining nations of Earth.
	</p>

	<p>You take the role of the Commander, a newly hired commanding officer for the Private Military Company Griffin and Kryuger.
	The PMC was hired by the New Soviet Union government to combat Sangvis Ferri, a former DOLL production company that
	was overthrown by their own creations during an event known as the Butterfly Incident. You command squads of your own
	Tactical DOLLs to battle with the rogue androids of Sangvis Ferri and retake the captured Eastern European regions.
	Each of your own Tactical DOLLs are unique characters of their own with a squad known as "Anti-Rain" or "AR Team" serving as
	as the main protagonists of the overall story. Created personally by the leading developer of DOLL technology Persica of 16Lab,
	AR Team is a squad of elite Tactical DOLLs that can operate independently from human commanders. As the story
	goes on many twists and reveals occur escalating the stakes and scale of the conflict beyond the Sangvis Ferri war. 
	New developements and characters get introduced and the world of Girls Frontline is explored allowing for a really compelling
	narrative that takes the player across multiple different countries in Eastern Europe.</p>

	<h4>Gameplay</h4>
	<p>
	Girls Frontline is a strategy RPG that requires the player to plan out and think about their moves, team composition, positioning,
	and resouce management along with elements of RPGs such as character leveling and equipment that improves a T-DOLL's (Tactical DOLL) 
	combat effectiveness. Using the phone's touch screen or mouse if your using an emulator on the PC, you can select a T-DOLL team to
	move around the map using predeterimend lanes that you can take. Each movement takes a certain number of moves which if depleted you
	must end the turn triggering the enemy's turn where they will move their own units. When your team and an enemy unit meet on the map 
	they both engage in a battle where you will control your own squad's movements on a grid and activate their special abilities to swing
	the battle into you favor. Each map will have a specific objective that you must complete while making sure that you don't get your own
	squads destroyed or your command center taken. Each squad also consumes ammunition and rations while they are on the field and 
	engage in a fight so you must also make sure you don't get caught out with no supplies by taking heliports that refill your ammo
	and rations while also serving as a new spawn/deploy space for you to call in reinforcements.

	<p>One of the other important gameplay aspects is the gacha system which ties into team composition and the light RPG elements. "Gacha" 
	is the name for a type of gameplay style that involves collecting either characters or equipment through random pulls which use a
	certain resource or currency. Girls Frontline is one of the more forgiving gacha games on the market as the resources requierd to pull
	characters are extremely easy to obtain unlimitedly for free. Resources and Contracts can be obtained via daily quests, completeting missions
	for the first time, or most importantly through logistics missions. Logistics missions requires players to send a team of DOLLs for a set 
	amount of time to obtain resources and contracts upon completion of the timer. This method is the fastest and easiest way to obtain resources
	as the player doesn't need to do anything other than sending a team off to complete the chosen mission and wait for their return. This method can 
	grant the player hundreds of thousands of resources and contracts as they progress through the main story unlocking more logistics missions that 
	grant even larger amounts of resources. You will need these resources as not only are they used for combat and repairs but also for pulling characters.
	Using T-DOLL production will grant you a random chance to pull one of the hundreds of characters Girls Frontline has to offer with varying degrees of 
	rairity each. Each T-DOLL is their own unique character and typically comes in rarities of 2 through 5 stars (2 star being the most common while 5 stars
	are the rarest). Despite the rarities however there many common and lower rarity T-DOLLs that are viable to use and can carry you through most of the
	game's content due to their good stats and abilities. Having many characters in your roster is important as team building is pivotal to your success in 
	game. Each T-DOLL can buff certain other classes of DOLLs relative to their position in battle.</p><div id="production"></div>

	<p>This emphasizes the player to synergize between multiple different types of T-DOLLs and placing them in many different squad formations in order 
	to get the full benefits of their buffs. The other important factor to T-DOLLs is the light RPG elements such as levels, equipment, and special abilities. 
	Leveling up a T-DOLL boosts their stats and unlocks equipment slots that they can use to boost their combat effectiveness using various different equipment such as special ammo, 
	exoskeletons, scopes, and other useful tools. Each T-DOLL also has a special ability that they can activate in battle which can turn the tide into your favor.
	</p>

	<p>As you progress through the game many other gameplay features will unlock for you to use such as the Neural Upgrade System which allows you to "evolve"
	a T-DOLL granting them new special abilities, increasing their stats, giving them custom special equipment, and even changing their appearance or introducing
	Fairies and Heavy Ordinance Crews which provide support in various different ways. The game is still being updated constantly with new major story events and
	gameplay features which provides something fresh for a player to do every patch and update.</p>
